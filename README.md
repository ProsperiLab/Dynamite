# HIVdynamite <beta>
dynamic identification of transmission clusters in phylogenies

* This project is still in beta and as such may contain major bugs and we do not guarantee proper results/functionality

HIVdynamite.R will generate 3 folders as output.


For example, a 10 slice tree will result in:

HOW TO EXECUTE (BASIC) -- Requires R 3.3 or higher:

```R
source("HIVdynamite.R")
processTree(tree_file.nwk)
```

Important functions (with defaults):

```R
processTree(input_tree, slice_count=10, bootstrap=0.70, min_leaves=15, perc_dist=0.05)
plotClusters(percentiles, node_tree_file="./treeFigures/node_tree.nwk",
             processed_tree_table="./treeTables/processedTree.csv",
             width = 16, height = 16, units = "in", dpi = 600)
```

Node enumeration:
By convention, the tips of the tree are numbered 1 through n for n tips; and the nodes are numbered n + 1 through n + m for m nodes. m = n - 1 for a fully bifurcating tree. So, if there are 10 leaves, then the root number is 11. From the root (11), nodes are enumerated in a depth-first manner (This follows the convention of the R package ape numbering scheme).

An example image may be generated using:

```R
library(ape)

tree <- read.tree(text = "(((A,B),(C,D)),(E,F));")
plot(tree, edge.width = 2, label.offset = 0.1)
nodelabels()
tiplabels()
```
